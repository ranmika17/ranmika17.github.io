    <p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">
      🏏Cricket is one of my favourite things to talk about. I love that <i>game</i> so much. But why did I <i><b>leave my team then</i>?</b> I am going to reveal the real reason for leaving my team behind.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 How good was I really?</h2>
    <p>
      I was a <b><i>npc</i></b> in my team back then. I didn’t care at first,⭕ because I just played for fun.😗 Later I wanted <b>RISE</b>. I worked hard and got selected to team B first. I was better than some <i><s>GOOFY</s></i> Team B teammates,😁 but Team A was on another level.💥💯 Later I joined Team A. I think I was good at cricket.😈 I rate myself 7/10.🙇‍♂️🤷‍♀️ The reason I left cricket was to focus more on <b>STUDY</b>. I had to <b>raise my grades</b> as I couldn’t improve them anymore.🤣 Not funny tho😑👊
    </p>
    

    <h2>🏋️‍♂️ Training & Discipline</h2>
    <p>
    After joining Team A, I realized that talent alone wasn’t enough. I had to train harder than ever.💪  
    Early mornings, long practices, and strict routines became my life. Some days I felt exhausted 😓, but the thrill of improvement kept me going.  
    Discipline taught me patience and consistency — skills that later helped me not just in cricket but in studies and life in general.
    </p>
    
    <h2>🤝 Team Dynamics</h2>
    <p>
    Being in Team A was a different world. Everyone had skills, but teamwork was key. I learned that communication, support, and understanding your teammates’ strengths were just as important as personal talent.  
    I also learned how to handle competition. Not everyone is your friend in sports, but respect goes a long way. 🏏✨
    </p>
    
    <h2>🎯 Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.</li>
      <li>Never underestimate the power of consistency.</li>
      <li>Team spirit and collaboration are essential.</li>
      <li>Balancing studies and sports is tough but necessary.</li>
      <li>Failures are stepping stones, not setbacks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>💡 Reflections</h2>
    <p>
    Looking back, leaving my old team was a tough choice, but it led me to better opportunities and growth. Cricket taught me life lessons I couldn’t learn anywhere else.  
    It wasn’t just about scoring runs or winning matches — it was about discipline, passion, and perseverance.🔥
    </p>
    
    <h2>🚀 Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>
    Even though I don’t play competitively anymore, cricket remains a huge part of who I am. I carry the lessons, the memories, and the friendships I made on and off the field.  
    And yes, I still watch matches, cheer for my favorite teams, and dream of one day coaching or mentoring young talent. 🙌
